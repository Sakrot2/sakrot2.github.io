[Chapter 1: Arrival]
(In another universe)
2NDGOD: You can't go there. It is a violation of rules. GET PERMISSION FROM THE SUPREME GOD FIRST!
2NDSAKROT:Just get out of my way. I am going to roast that SAKROT from another universe.
2NDGOD: You are going from here with my life.
2NDSAKROT: EASY PEASY LEMON SQUEZZY! 

Then 2NDSAKROT blasted away GOD and got out of the portal that was leading to the another universe.

2NDGOD: DAMN IT! He is gonna get huge punishment with the SUPRME GOD here. But I will have to wait 10 minutes before the portal can be activated again.

(In Our Universe)
After Sakrot defeated his brother. He started living in peace. until something bad again happened that required him to be involved. And that was someone
who looked just like him. Like his own self.

SAKROT: Who are you?
???: Does it really matter? Anyways, I am here to kill every one in this planet
SAKROT(Getting into fighting postition): What have we done to you that you have to destroy this planet.
???: This planet has done every single thing to me. And yeah! Where are my manners? My name is SAKROT!
SAKROT: Wait..... You sound like me, look like me and EVEN HAVE THE SAME NAME AS ME? Something is going fishy here.
2NDSAKROT: Oh! So you are the SAKROT of this universe? I should have expected it since you looked like me.
2NDSAKROT: But, you are here protecting this planet aren't you? Then let's see if you can beat my speed.

Then 2NDSAKROT charges up and rushes at someplace. SAKROT follows him.

SAKROT: Where the heck are you going???
2NDSAKROT: NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS! JUST FOLLOW ME!

After that, 2NDSAKROT took SAKROT to some kind of empty place to which we are guessing to fight.

SAKROT: So you want to fight huh??? Then let's get this party going!
2NDSAKROT: Then why don't you use your SUPERSAKROT form of yours?
SAKROT: Huh? (Looks down)
2NDSAKROT: What happened? Can't you use it? You used it against KRIEZA didn't you?
SAKROT: Yes I did. But.
2NDSAKROT: But what?
SAKROT: I did it by COMPLETE RAGE and ANGER. I don't even remember the feeling now.
2NDSAKROT: Is that it? Then see my SUPERSAKROT form.
SAKROT: Huh?
2NDSAKROT: HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!----
SAKROT: IS HE SERIOUS????
2NDSAKROT: HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!---
SAKROT: IT LOOKS MORE POWERFUL THAN EVER
2NDSAKROT: HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!---
SAKROT(In Mind): Oh shoot! If I run away from here then he will surely catch up to me and if I fight here than there is a higher chance that I will die.
SAKROT(In Mind): Suck it! If I die, I die from honour.
SAKROT: SAIOKEN!!!
2NDSAKROT:HAAAAA!!
2NDSAKROT:Hmm?

Then 2NDSAKROT like SAKROT grew some hair but this time it was green in color.

2NDSAKROT: Personally, I don't like the green colour but. This is all I have.
SAKROT: SHUT UP AND FIGHT ME.

Then SAKROT threw a punch at 2NDSAKROT's Cheeks but it didn't have any effect. 

2NDSAKROT: AWW!! How cute. SAIOKEN trying to beat SUPER form.

Then 2NDSAKROT kicked SAKROT in his guts! And SAKROT was sent flying away to a distance. Then 2NDSAKROT rushed to SAKROT and was just about to punch him to his face. But Just in time 2NDGOD appeared and paralyzed him.

2NDGOD: You are going to get to so much trouble. Do you realize that?
2NDSAKROT: Tch!
2NDGOD: I am so sorry SAKROT of this universe. This guy came here without permission to kill you. That was a foolish move as you can see.
SAKROT: Uhh... Yeah..
2NDGOD: So now, We gotta go. Bye! Take care. 

Then 2NDSAKROT was sent to his own universe again.

Now, Sakrot fell to the ground.

SAKROT: Well, this went out fast. But, this was a declaration of war. I need to prepare and get that SUPER SAKROT form really fast. I need GOD to help me.

Then SAKROT went to the GOD.

(In Another Universe)
2NDSAKROT: You are gonna pay for this, I am telling you.
2NDGOD: At first learn what your punishment is, SAKROT:
2NDSUPREME GOD: So you arrived, SAKROT!?

[Chapter 1:END]

[Chapter 2: A Teacher??]

(In Another Universe)
2NDSAKROT: Gosh Dang it! SG! Why the heck do I always get punishment?
2NDSUPREME GOD: Because. You are a threatening being to this universe and now this turn has made 5 total threats. Now it is mandatory for me to destroy you.
2NDSAKROT: It can't be!
2NDSUPREME GOD: God of Destruction SHAMPA! Come here and destroy him.
SHAMPA(Proceeds to 2NDSAKROT): You time has come to an end SAKROT. I hope... to .... never... see you again!
???: This is not going to end like this.
2NDSAKROT,SHAMPA,2NDSUPREME GOD: HUH?

Then ??? kicked SHAMPA right at the face. And managed to take the attention of 2NDSUPREME GOD on him. Then he ran with 2NDSAKROT as fast as he could.

2NDSUPREME GOD: NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!

(In the Place ??? took 2NDSAKROT)
2NDSAKROT: Ha...Ha..Ha.. You saved me there TOSHONORI....
TOSHONORI: That was not a big deal since I am stronger than the G.O.D.
2NDSAKROT: We need to be out of reach for now... Let's go
TOSHONORI: Yeah! Let's Go!

2NDSUPREMEGOD: Where the heck did they run off too??? I need to find them

Then 2NDSAKROT and TOSHONORI procceded to the place where the portal was.

2NDSAKROT: The moment I go down this portal. You need to destroy it.
TOSHONORI: O.... Wait.. Then you won't be able to come back.
2NDSAKROT: Yes, I ca............

Then A Blast occurs. It was 2NDSUPREME GOD.

2NDSUPREME GOD: All this trouble was caused by this Portal. I'll have to destroy it..
TOSHONORI: No you don't!

Then When 2NDSUPREME GOD tried to destroy the portal, TOSHONORI stood right in front of the Portal. Then TOSHONORI was heavily damaged but the portal managed to survive.

TOSHONORI: SAKROT! NOW!!
2NDSAKROT: NO! I am not going with you injured here!
TOSHONORI: JUST DO AS I SAY! GET OUT OF HERE! I AM YOUR TEACHER! OBEY ME!!!
2NDSAKROT: HUH? YOU EXPECT ME TO DO THAT? NEVER!
2NDSUPREME GOD(In Mind): This is getting out of hand! 

Then 2NDSUPREME GOD Finally destroyed the Portal by punching it!

TOSHONORI: SAKROT! I TOLD YOU TO GO NOW THERE IS NO CHANCE YOU WILL GET TO DEFEAT THAT BASTARD!!
2NDSAKROT: I DON'T CARE! LET'S JUST GET OUT OF HERE FOR NOW!!!

Then 2NDSAKROT threw TOSHONORI into the sky! Then 2NDSAKROT flew off to another direction!

2NDSUPREME GOD: I need to think this fast! GO!!

Then 2NDSUPREME GOD Threw 2 blasts at both directions. 2NDSAKROT saw this and prevented TOSHONORI from getting hit but got hit himself and got heavily injured.

TOSHONORI: That was heavily stupid and unnecassary! You didn't need to do that!
2NDSAKROT: If I didn't have my Teacher, then I won't be in the position I am today..
TOSHONORI: Sakrot?
2NDSAKROT: A.K.A Thank you for being there with me I appreciate it a lot.
TOSHONORI: .........thanks.....

(In our Universe)
SAKROT: And there was this guy who looked just like me but... YEAH! Had no eyebrows....
GOD: I think that you are day-dreaming! But if you really want to learn how to control this power of SUPER SAKROT then I can teach you.
SAKROT: I am not kidding! But thanks for the help!!

(In Another Universe)
TOSHONORI: Then What are ya gonna do?
2NDSAKROT: I have a idea. I know how to make this portal. Let's go!
TOSHONORI: Do you actually know it or are you kidding?
2NDSAKROT: I am not kidding but lets have some rest first.
TOSHONORI: I agree!

(In Our Universe)
SAKROT is lifting weights

GOD: Gosh dang it! Lift it dude lift it! You need strength you know?
SAKROT: I know Damn It! But it is like 1000 TONS!!!!
GOD: I can lift 7 million tons you know?
SAKROT: WHAT??? YOU ARE THAT STRONG??
GOD: Nah!! Just Kidding.
SAKROT: Lol. And I nearly thought that you were the str...
GOD: I only can lift up to 5 million tons!
SAKROT: THAT STILL IS A LOT THO!!!
GOD: Enough talking LIFT! LIFT! LIIIIIFFFTTT!!!!!!
SAKROT: OK! OK! I GET IT!!
[Chapter 2: END]

[Chapter 3: Training]
(In Our Universe)
SAKROT: So... Wait.... Then if you are stronger than anyone other than the God of Destruction and the Supreme God then why don't you fight?
GOD: I am not permitted to fight! If I give one punch to someone then I will immediately get erased!
SAKROT: Wait What? Why Though??
GOD: To maintain balance SAKROT. If a GOD is permitted to fight then he will be able to do anything he wants. Even the God of Destruction can't destroy things without the permission of the Supreme God. The Erasing things only apply to Gods though.
SAKROT: So that means to make the GOD do nothing but creation and to control the God of Destruction, this rule was made.
GOD: Basically yeah...

(In Another Universe)
2NDSAKROT: So. We need that and then the portal will surely appear.
TOSHONORI: Is that so? Then what are we actually waiting for? Let's go
2NDSAKROT: Yeah. Let's go.

Then 2NDSAKROT and TOSHONORI both took off to some place. The place looked like it was pitched black with some crystals in it.

TOSHONORI: I can't believe that this portal can be made with these crystals.
2NDSAKROT: Hide your presence. Right now!
TOSHONORI: Oh? OK!

After that, we see 2NDGOD.

2NDGOD: DAMN IT! THEY HID THEIR PRESENCE. I SWEAR THEY ARE HERE SOMEWHERE. DANG IT! DANG IT!!!!!

2NDSAKROT: Let's do this.
TOSHONORI: Yeah.
2NDSAKROT: (Chants a spell) WAKE UP SUMETE PORTAL!!!

Then the Portal wakes up.

2NDGOD: There. I have to go fast.

2NDSAKROT: This time we have to do it fast. Destroy it while I am gone Okay?
2NDGOD: NO YOUR NOT!!
2NDSAKROT: CRAP!! LET'S BOTH GO!
TOSHONORI: RIGHT!!

Then 2NDSAKROT and TOSHONORI both went by the portal.

2NDGOD: SHIT! Now I can't go there because it was ignited with the crystal and it can only be done for ONCE!!! I NEED TO FIND ANOTHER ONE!

(In Our Universe)
2NDSAKROT: WHEW!! That was close!
TOSHONORI: Yeah. You are right about that!
2NDSAKROT: Now to find that SAKROT of this universe….
TOSHONORI: Why don’t you sense his presence?
2NDSAKROT: Good idea! 
Then 2NDSAKROT closed his eyes and concentrated on finding Sakrot’s presence. He tried for at least 5 minutes
TOSHONORI: No sign, huh?
2NDSAKROT: Yeah! I am worried he might not be in this planet.
TOSHONORI: Then while we are here, why not have fun then.
(In the God’s place)
SAKROT: You sense something god?
GOD: Nope.
SAKROT: Maybe my imagination is doing it then.
SAKROT (In Mind): I have a bad feeling, but I don’t know why.
(In Earth)
TOSHONORI: Why not have fun then?
2NDSAKROT: Yeah!! Why not?
TOSHONORI: Let’s go!
Then TOSHONORI and 2NDSAKROT went to a big city and then 2NDSAKROT threw an energy ball at the city and then it was crumbled.
SAKROT sensed it.
SAKROT: Oh no, something wrong is going on in Earth.
GOD: You’re right! There is someone who looks just like you. And I believe that he’s from another universe.
SAKROT: Another Universe? I believe he said something like that but what exactly is it?
GOD: Remember? We don’t have time. Let’s go
SAKROT: Oh yeah! Let’s go!
Then SAKROT and GOD went to Earth. Then there they see two people, TOSHONORI and 2NDSAKROT.
TOSHONORI: So they are our enemies?
2NDSAKROT: You got that right!
SAKROT: Hmph. So you brought an ally with you this time huh? Either way I am still going to beat you!
2NDSAKROT: How exactly? You don’t even have the SUPERSAKROT form now!
SAKROT: Let’s see about that!
2NDSAKROT: Huh?
SAKROT: HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2NDSAKROT: So here he was training huh? Let’s see what his color of hair is.
SAKROT: HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
2NDSAKROT: So in SUPERSAKROT form your hair turns red?
SAKROT: You got that right, but now see this!
SAKROT: HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2NDSAKROT: What the heck?
SAKROT: ……… This is the form SUPERSAKROT mixed with GOD ENERGY!
2NDSAKROT: God energy? Don’t tell me!
[In the past: While training]
SAKROT: HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Then SAKROT turned into SUPERSAKROT.
GOD: Then you have mastered this form already? You sure are a fast learner.
SAKROT: Thanks!
GOD: I am going to give you another form now!
SAKROT: What?
GOD: Here, now you have GOD ENERGY!
SAKROT: GOD ENERGY?
GOD: That’s right! You will become hundred times stronger
[In Present]
In this form, his hair was blue. 2NDSAKROT was very shocked.
SAKROT: You will never be able to get this form because no one will give you GOD ENERGY!
GOD: YOU GOT THAT RIGHT!
2NDSAKROT (In mind): Oh SHOOT!!! THIS GUY IS A THOUSAND TIMES STRONGER THAN ME NOW! AND THAT’S WHY I HATE HIM! HE CAN ALWAYS BECOME STRONGER THAN ME!!!!
SAKROT: Then, shall we get this fight started?
2NDSAKROT: …
