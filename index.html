[Chapter 1: Arrival]
(In another universe)
2NDGOD: You can't go there. It is a violation of rules. GET PERMISSION FROM THE SUPREME GOD FIRST!
2NDSAKROT:Just get out of my way. I am going to roast that SAKROT from another universe.
2NDGOD: You are going from here with my life.
2NDSAKROT: EASY PEASY LEMON SQUEZZY! 

Then 2NDSAKROT blasted away GOD and got out of the portal that was leading to the another universe.

2NDGOD: DAMN IT! He is gonna get huge punishment with the SUPRME GOD here. But I will have to wait 10 minutes before the portal can be activated again.

(In Our Universe)
After Sakrot defeated his brother. He started living in peace. until something bad again happened that required him to be involved. And that was someone
who looked just like him. Like his own self.

SAKROT: Who are you?
???: Does it really matter? Anyways, I am here to kill every one in this planet
SAKROT(Getting into fighting postition): What have we done to you that you have to destroy this planet.
???: This planet has done every single thing to me. And yeah! Where are my manners? My name is SAKROT!
SAKROT: Wait..... You sound like me, look like me and EVEN HAVE THE SAME NAME AS ME? Something is going fishy here.
2NDSAKROT: Oh! So you are the SAKROT of this universe? I should have expected it since you looked like me.
2NDSAKROT: But, you are here protecting this planet aren't you? Then let's see if you can beat my speed.

Then 2NDSAKROT charges up and rushes at someplace. SAKROT follows him.

SAKROT: Where the heck are you going???
2NDSAKROT: NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS! JUST FOLLOW ME!

After that, 2NDSAKROT took SAKROT to some kind of empty place to which we are guessing to fight.

SAKROT: So you want to fight huh??? Then let's get this party going!
2NDSAKROT: Then why don't you use your SUPERSAKROT form of yours?
SAKROT: Huh? (Looks down)
2NDSAKROT: What happened? Can't you use it? You used it against KRIEZA didn't you?
SAKROT: Yes I did. But.
2NDSAKROT: But what?
SAKROT: I did it by COMPLETE RAGE and ANGER. I don't even remember the feeling now.
2NDSAKROT: Is that it? Then see my SUPERSAKROT form.
SAKROT: Huh?
2NDSAKROT: HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!----
SAKROT: IS HE SERIOUS????
2NDSAKROT: HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!---
SAKROT: IT LOOKS MORE POWERFUL THAN EVER
2NDSAKROT: HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!---
SAKROT(In Mind): Oh shoot! If I run away from here then he will surely catch up to me and if I fight here than there is a higher chance that I will die.
SAKROT(In Mind): Suck it! If I die, I die from honour.
SAKROT: SAIOKEN!!!
2NDSAKROT:HAAAAA!!
2NDSAKROT:Hmm?

Then 2NDSAKROT like SAKROT grew some hair but this time it was green in color.

2NDSAKROT: Personally, I don't like the green colour but. This is all I have.
SAKROT: SHUT UP AND FIGHT ME.

Then SAKROT threw a punch at 2NDSAKROT's Cheeks but it didn't have any effect. 

2NDSAKROT: AWW!! How cute. SAIOKEN trying to beat SUPER form.

Then 2NDSAKROT kicked SAKROT in his guts! And SAKROT was sent flying away to a distance. Then 2NDSAKROT rushed to SAKROT and was just about to punch him to his face. But Just in time 2NDGOD appeared and paralyzed him.

2NDGOD: You are going to get to so much trouble. Do you realize that?
2NDSAKROT: Tch!
2NDGOD: I am so sorry SAKROT of this universe. This guy came here without permission to kill you. That was a foolish move as you can see.
SAKROT: Uhh... Yeah..
2NDGOD: So now, We gotta go. Bye! Take care. 

Then 2NDSAKROT was sent to his own universe again.

Now, Sakrot fell to the ground.

SAKROT: Well, this went out fast. But, this was a declaration of war. I need to prepare and get that SUPER SAKROT form really fast. I need GOD to help me.

Then SAKROT went to the GOD.

(In Another Universe)
2NDSAKROT: You are gonna pay for this, I am telling you.
2NDGOD: At first learn what your punishment is, SAKROT:
2NDSUPREME GOD: So you arrived, SAKROT!?

(In Another Universe)
2NDSAKROT: Gosh Dang it! SG! Why the heck do I always get punishment?
2NDSUPREME GOD: Because. You are a threatening being to this universe and now this turn has made 5 total threats. Now it is mandatory for me to destroy you.
2NDSAKROT: It can't be!
2NDSUPREME GOD: God of Destruction SHAMPA! Come here and destroy him.
SHAMPA(Proceeds to 2NDSAKROT): You time has come to an end SAKROT. I hope... to .... never... see you again!
???: This is not going to end like this.
2NDSAKROT,SHAMPA,2NDSUPREME GOD: HUH?

Then ??? kicked SHAMPA right at the face. And managed to take the attention of 2NDSUPREME GOD on him. Then he ran with 2NDSAKROT as fast as he could.

2NDSUPREME GOD: NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!

(In the Place ??? took 2NDSAKROT)
2NDSAKROT: Ha...Ha..Ha.. You saved me there TOSHONORI....
TOSHONORI: That was not a big deal since I am stronger than the G.O.D.
2NDSAKROT: We need to be out of reach for now... Let's go
TOSHONORI: Yeah! Let's Go!

2NDSUPREMEGOD: Where the heck did they run off too??? I need to find them

Then 2NDSAKROT and TOSHONORI procceded to the place where the portal was.

2NDSAKROT: The moment I go down this portal. You need to destroy it.
TOSHONORI: O.... Wait.. Then you won't be able to come back.
2NDSAKROT: Yes, I ca............

Then A Blast occurs. It was 2NDSUPREME GOD.

2NDSUPREME GOD: All this trouble was caused by this Portal. I'll have to destroy it..
TOSHONORI: No you don't!

Then When 2NDSUPREME GOD tried to destroy the portal, TOSHONORI stood right in front of the Portal. Then TOSHONORI was heavily damaged but the portal managed to survive.

TOSHONORI: SAKROT! NOW!!
2NDSAKROT: NO! I am not going with you injured here!
TOSHONORI: JUST DO AS I SAY! GET OUT OF HERE! I AM YOUR TEACHER! OBEY ME!!!
2NDSAKROT: HUH? YOU EXPECT ME TO DO THAT? NEVER!

Then 2NDSUPREME GOD Threw 2 blasts at both directions. 2NDSAKROT saw this and prevented TOSHONORI from getting hit but got hit himself and got heavily injured.

TOSHONORI: That was heavily stupid and unnecassary! You didn't need to do that!
