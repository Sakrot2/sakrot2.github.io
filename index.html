    <pre>
    (Sakrot was called to Supreme God for his efforts on destroying the rule-breaker Sakrot from another universe. We see Sakrot here now)
SAKROT: With all due respect your majesty, why was I called here?
SUPREME GOD: You are here because you are awesome!
SAKROT (Confused): Huh?
SUPREME GOD: I mean that you are here because I need to provide you enough respect for your hard work against the rule-breaker SAKROT from another universe.
SAKROT: Well ok. But one question, why was I not called here when I defeated Krieza?
SUPREME GOD: Krieza? You mean that fake Destruction guy? Well, he was no problem really; we were going to take care of it anyways.
SAKROT: I agree with you my lord.
SUPREME GOD: And here I am going to ask you one question.
SAKROT (Bowing head down): Go ahead my lord.
SUPREME GOD: Will you be my apprentice to be the next Supreme God?
SAKROT (Mind Blown): Wait WHAT? WHY ME????? THERE ARE LIKE MILLIONS OF OTHER PEOPLE LIVING IN THIS UNIVERSE??? AND WHY DOES IT HAVE TO BE ME?????
SUPREME GOD (Laughing): Look Sakrot, you are kind, pure of soul and also really powerful. I couldn’t find anyone better apprentice then you my dear friend!
SAKROT (Confused): Friend?
SUPREME GOD: Yeah. Call me Callan from here on out.
SAKROT: Ok I got it, Callan.
CALLAN: Ok man. Let’s take you through the steps.
SAKROT: Ok then.
CALLAN: Ok. So, to become the Supreme God, you need to follow some important steps. This is what we call as trials. There are total of 5 trials. And there are guards which we call as elementals. They each posse one element classified as:
-	Fire Element
-	Earth Element
-	Lightning Element
-	Darkness Element
-	Water Element
SUPREME GOD: Each one, you will have to pass carefully, because you are not marked only for defeating the elemental, but the marking is based on skill only.
SAKROT: Oh, then I have to defeat all of them to become the next Supreme God?
SUPREME GOD: Basically, yeah.
SAKROT: Sounds good. I’m in.
SUPREME GOD: Very well. Do you want to start now?
SAKROT: Yeah sure!
SUPREME GOD: Then let’s get you to the FIRE ELEMENTAL!!!
(Then Sakrot is teleported to some kind of volcanic place with fire and lava all over the place.)
SAKROT (Confused): Where the heck am I???
? : You came here….
SAKROT (Turning around): Huh?
? : …That means you are the next apprentice for the Supreme God. I got to say, I am disappointed.
SAKROT: What?
? : Let me get this turned around. I am the Fire Elemental Hell flame.
SAKROT: Still. Why are you disappointed in me?
Hell flame: Because your power level is very low and you don’t have any elementals??? SUPREME GOD WHY DID I HAVE TO BE THE FIRST ONE?
SAKROT (Getting into fighting position): Then that is it. Then without getting further, let’s get this battle started.
(Hell flame is now running very fast that SAKROT can’t see him, Hell flame is attacking at the same time too)
SAKROT: This speed.
Hell flame: This is only the 1st hurdle you will face. Now defeat me with all you got!!!!!
SAKROT (In His Mind): He’s too fast. I can’t beat him like this. I got to think of a plan. Think…. Think…. Think… Wait, he is going through running through lava only. This is my chance!
(Then SAKROT blocks all the ways of lava using small and big both stones)
Hell flame: Well done.
SAKROT: Hehe 
Hell flame: This was the easiest one to be honest. Let’s take you to a real test.
SAKROT: Ok!
Hell flame: Fight me with all you’ve got!
SAKROT: GOT IT!!
Hell flame: Here I come!
(Then Hell flame rushed to SAKROT and punches him in the gut! SAKROT is throwing blood from his mouth now)
SAKROT: How…. Are you this strong???
Hell flame: That’s why I said that I was disappointed. You have a long way to go if you want to beat me young man.
SAKROT: Damn it!!! Damn it all to hell! I am not GIVING UP!!! AAAAAAAGAAAAHAHHAHHAHHAH!!
(Then Sakrot transformed into SUPER SAKROT with God energy!)
Hell flame: What? You were saving your energy?
SAKROT: What if I was? And yeah, I call this form Super Sakrot 2!
Hell Flame: I have to say I am impressed! In this form you are pretty strong considering you are a mere mortal!
SAKROT: Yeah. It’s because I have God Energy!
Hell Flame: What? You have god energy? That’s good to know!
(Then Hell Flame ran into Sakrot)
Hell Flame: But it still isn’t enough to beat me!
(And then Hell Flame Punched SAKROT right at the face! SAKROT is sent flying to a wall!)
Hell Flame: I can’t afford to hold back now. Prepare yourselves!

      <p> Chapter 2: Fight with the First Elemental: Hell Flame </p>
    </center>
    <pre>
    Hell Flame: I can’t afford to hold back now. Prepare yourselves!
SAKROT: Shit!
(Hell Flame now started throwing energy balls at SAKROT as SAKROT is dodging them doing a back flip!)
SAKROT: This won’t work against me!
Hell Flame: Yeah? Then Take THIS!!!
SAKROT: What?
(Hell Flame had been storing up fire energy up till now and is now being ready to throw it at SAKROT now)
SAKROT (In His Mind): What the heck is this madness? These trials are super hard!
Hell Flame: Super move: Hell BLAST!!
SAKROT: DAMN IT!!
(Then Hell flame threw the blast at SAKROT, SAKROT is withstanding it barely!)
Hell Flame: You should give up now, if I am being honest!
SAKROT: SHUT UP!
(Then SAKROT pushed the blast with all his power and it still wasn’t enough!)
Hell Flame: You are not as strong as you think yourself to be! I suggest you give up, train and come here again to fight me with more power!
SAKROT: I…. am…. Not….. Going to…….GIVE UP!!
Hell Flame: Oh How Sweet!
SAKROT: I AM NOT GOING TO GIVE UP! AAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
(Then SAKROT surpassed his limits and pushed the blast up to the point of Hell Flame! Hell Flame got really injured at that time! And now SAKROT has given his all and is lying in the floor for now!
Hell Flame: What….. Are…. You
SAKROT: I don’t know… But all I want to do is protect everyone present here in this universe and save every innocent lives as long as I am here!
Hell flame: You seem to be a good guy then!
(Then SAKROT fainted!)
Hell Flame: SAKROT? WHAT THE HECK MAN!!!
(Then SAKROT and Hell Flame went to SUPREME GOD!)
Hell Flame (Bowing head): Please take care of him.
CALLAN: That’s rather unusual of you to think of somebody!
Hell Flame: I think that he is worthy of being the next Supreme God! I’ve not seen that in a very long time.
CALLAN: I have to admit! He got some potential! For now, he has to rest and his time will soon come to face the other elemental!
Hell Flame: Yeah! Oh I totally forgot to give SAKROT his powers!
CALLAN: Don’t worry! I’ll give it to him!
Hell Flame: Thanks sir! Now I will have to go!
(Then Hell Flame goes to his own place)
(After Some Time)
(SAKROT is sleeping and now slowly opening his eyes!)
SAKROT: Huh? Where am I? This looks awfully familiar to Callan’s palace!
CALLAN’S SERVENT: SIR SUPREME GOD! SAKROT HAS AWOKEN FROM HIS DREAMS!
SAKROT: What the… THAT WAS LOUD!!
SAKROT: Oh… So this is the place of Callan!
(CALLAN is coming to the room)
CALLAN: You awake?
SAKROT: Yeah.
CALLAN: Ok. It’s time for you to give the fire elemental!
SAKROT: What? But I lost right?
CALLAN: Oh, SAKROT what did I tell you about the marking?
SAKROT: Yeah, it was that it is not marked by winning but by my skills.
CALLAN: So then….
SAKROT: Oh! I won by my skill!
CALLAN: You are right!
SAKROT: I am so grateful right now to be honest!
CALLAN: You should be! Now let’s give you your powers!
(Then CALLAN gave fire power to SAKROT!)
SAKROT: Wow. I feel different!
CALLAN: Now try to use it!
SAKROT: How do I?
CALLAN: Focus all of your energy in your hand and think of fire!
SAKROT: Ok!
(Then SAKROT’s hand was covered with Aura after he focused his energy to his hand and as soon as it lit! There came fire!)
SAKROT: WOW!!!
CALLAN: You see? It’s amazing right?
SAKROT: HECK YEAH!!
CALLAN: Now through that shit on to me!
SAKROT: You bet!
(Then SAKROT threw the fire onto CALLAN and CALLAN immediately destroyed it with his water element!)
SAKROT: I knew you would use that!
CALLAN: Haha!
(Then CALLAN threw lightning at SAKROT!)
CALLAN: CHECKMATE!!
SAKROT: WHAT THE HECK MAN!
CALLAN: You still have a lot to learn and that includes getting your guard up!
SAKROT: Huh?
CALLAN: If you know what I mean!
SAKROT (Confused): What?
CALLAN: You will know soon enough!
SAKROT: Ok then.
(Then SAKROT was being ready to go home.)
SAKROT: It is time… to train!

      <p> Chapter 3: Training For Something! </p>
    </center>
    <pre>
    SAKROT: It is time… to train!
SAKROT: Whom should I train with then? (Thinks for some time) Oh whom do I know? Callan’s right there with me!
(SAKROT goes to Callan)
CALLAN: You want to train with me?
SAKROT: Sure I do!!
CALLAN: What if I disagree?
SAKROT: Why would you? You are like the nicest per…….
CALLAN: I resign
SAKROT: WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON WITH YOU TODAY???
CALLAN: If I train you, there is a high possibility that the elementals will find out and they will start to hate on me since I trained you.
SAKROT: Why though?
CALLAN: They will think that because I trained you, you won. And yes, it is far better to learn a move yourself rather from a teaching or copy of someone.
SAKROT: …
CALLAN: Suit yourself SAKROT. This is your journey. This is to be completed by you and not others.
SAKROT: By myself…
(Then SAKROT went home. And now, SAKROT is meditating)
SAKROT: [SILENCE]
SAKROT (In his mind): By myself. A move made by me. What does he actually mean? Does he mean….
SAKROT: Anyways, I will focus on increasing my physical strength for now. Others later on!
(2 Days Has Gone By. SAKROT is doing push-ups)
SAKROT: Seven thousand nine hundred and fifty two…..Seven thousand nine hundred and fifty three…. AAH!
(Then SAKROT fell down in the floor)
SAKROT (Panting): That was too much for me.
SAKROT: Seven thousand nine hundred and fifty three. Is that enough? I really don’t think so.
SAKROT: Oh yeah. What Callan told me? I should develop my own moves and train on my own!
SAKROT: Let’s try to make a move then shall we?
(After Some time)
SAKROT: KAAAAAAA………MEEEEEEEEEEE……….HAAAAAAAAAAAAA……Oh.
SAKROT: That’s copying Goku’s move! That isn’t allowed is it? Then let’s try…
SAKROT: Wait I got it! The second elemental is the Earth one right??? Then I got the perfect plan for that!
(After a day of Practice)
SAKROT (Panting): Woo! That took a long time! Now I got to go to Callan now to defeat the earth element!
(SAKROT teleports to CALLAN)
CALLAN: Oh. You’ve arrived SAKROT? I think you have a plan don’t you?
SAKROT: Yes I do!
CALLAN: Then what are we waiting for. I want to see this match too. So let’s go together!
SAKROT: HELL YEAH!
(Then Sakrot and Callan get teleported to the place of Earth element. Then we are in some unknown place!)
? : You say someone is attending the Supreme God course right?
SERVANT: Yes sir!
? : That is good news! And what is his power level may I ask?
SERVANT: Recorded Approximately 50 billion!
? : 50 billion… It may be troublesome but I can handle it! Now you go and keep an eye on him!
SERVANT: Yes sir! 
(Then We Get Back to the Arena of The Earth Elemental!)
EARTH ELEMENTAL: I am so glad to see you Supreme God and his apprentice. I am the Earth Elemental Rete.
SAKROT: Rete? Where did that name come from?
RETE: Huh? It came from the word “Tree”.
SAKROT: “Tree” and “Rete”. T here, R there and two e’s there. Yeah seems legit.
CALLAN: Hehe. So, Rete? are you ready for this fight?
RETE: I had been waiting for this fight forever my lord.
CALLAN: Glad to hear that! I am going to sit in the sky and watch. You two fight!
SAKROT: You sure you are ready? Because I won’t hold back!
RETE: I don’t intend to hold back either! LAND BURST!
(Then parts of the land rose up into small mountains one by one!)
SAKROT: GO! INSTANT BLAST!
(Then SAKROT threw a ball of fire to the small mountains Rete had created and it was destroyed!)
SAKROT: It isn’t easy to defeat me!
CALLAN: Oh? So he’s mastered the fire control technique? That’s good to hear.
(Then SAKROT got hit on the chin by the small mountain of RETE!)
SAKROT: OUCH!! NO FAIR!!
RETE: You’ve held your guard down!
CALLAN: He’s still got a lot to learn though.
RETE: I am coming to you now!
(Then RETE turned himself into soil and got into the ground!)
SAKROT: I knew that would happen! HERE WE GO!
(Then SAKROT put his hands down on the floor and made it explode)
(RETE managed to come out of the soil just in time!)
RETE: That was neat!
SAKROT: That isn’t enough for me! EXPLOSIVE TURBO RUSHING BLAST!
(Then SAKROT rushed towards RETE and punched him in the gut and sent him flying of the border.)
(After SAKROT again rushed and charged up a fire blast and again punched at the gut of RETE but this time with the power of Fire!)
RETE: AAAHH!
SAKROT: GOTCHA!
(Then SAKROT flew back at his area!)
CALLAN: SAKROT has developed his own moves as I said him to do. He is a very fast learner.
RETE: I’ll have to say. You are pretty good.
SAKROT: Hehe. This was nothing to be honest!
RETE: Then you should’ve seen this coming!
SAKROT: Huh?
(Then SAKROT looks back and sees a combination of huge rocks in one rock!)
SAKROT: WHAT THE…. I DIDN’T EXPECT THAT!!
RETE: My element is Earth remember? And I figured this much out that you only have the fire element!
SAKROT: Tch…
RETE: And yeah, I could have used Water but I couldn’t find any of it here on range. So rock is enough for me!
SAKROT: This thing is too hard to beat!
